            "refined_text": "array of molecules that we call  organic compounds .  There are many different types of  organic compounds, but all have  carbon  as their principal constituent atom.  These carbon  atoms form a  carbon skeleton  or  carbon backbone  that has other bonded atoms such as H,  N, O, S, and the halogens (F, Cl, Br, and I).      We frequently hear the term \"organic\" in everyday language where it describes or refers to  substances that are \"natural\".  This is probably a result of the notion of early scientists that all  organic compounds came from living systems and possessed a \"vital force\".  However,  chemists learned over 170 years ago that this is not the case.  Organic compounds are major  components of living systems, but chemists can make many of them in the laboratory from  substances that have no direct connection with living systems.  Chemically speaking, a pure  sample of an organic compound such as Vitamin C prepared in a laboratory is chemically  identical to a pure sample of Vitamin C isolated from a natural source such as an orange or  other citrus fruit.    Your journey through organic chemistry will be challenging because of the large amount of  information that you will need to learn and understand.  However, we will explore this  subject in a systematic manner so that it is not a vast collection of isolated facts.  What you  learn in one chapter will serve as building blocks for the material in the chapter that follows  it.  In this sense, you may find that organic chemistry is different from general chemistry.   That course consists of a variety of discrete topics usually divided into separate segments in  textbooks.  In contrast, your organic chemistry instructors will present a course in which each  new topic uses information from previous topics to raise your understanding of organic  chemistry to successively higher levels.    This chapter provides a foundation for your studies of organic chemistry.  It begins with an  introduction to the important  classes  of organic molecules followed by a description of     3",

We will also explore  instrumental methods  that chemists use to determine the structures of organic molecules.      These techniques, generally referred to as  organic spectrometry , appear early in this text  because the determination of molecular structure is vitally important in organic chemistry.    Chemical Reactions   (1.3B)  Chemical reactions are the core of organic chemistry.  They convert one class of organic  molecules into another class and permit the  synthesis  of new molecules from those which  already exist.   Organic chemical reactions take place by a series of steps in which existing  chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form.  During these transformations, the  molecules undergoing chemical reaction experience changes in their chemical bonds and  their three-dimensional shapes.  We refer to the details of these changes as the  reaction   mechanisms  and we will discuss them in depth for various types of chemical reactions.      The types of mechanisms that characterize organic reactions depend to a significant extent on  the classes of molecules that are being interconverted.  They also depend on the polarity and  electron distribution in the molecules undergoing the reaction (the  reactants ), and those that  form in the reaction (the  products ).  For this reason, aspects of  molecular structure  are of  crucial importance in understanding the  chemical reactivity  of organic compounds.    Bioorganic Chemistry   (1.3C)      If your academic major is in one of the life sciences, you are studying organic chemistry  because all organisms are complex molecular assemblies made up of a vast number of  organic molecules.  You will see later in this text that these  bioorganic   molecules  have  functional groups identical to those described in this chapter.  You will also learn that most  of the  biochemical reactions  that occur in organisms are organic reactions with mechanisms  analogous to those that you will study in this course.    The bioorganic molecules that we will learn about include  carbohydrates ,  proteins ,  amino  acids ,  nucleic acids , and  lipids .  You probably already know that  carbohydrates  are  important as sources of energy in metabolism and as structural support in plants.   Proteins   are large molecules, made up of many  amino acids , that make up muscle tissue and serve as  enzymes.   Nucleic acids  are not only the molecular repository of our genetic code, but also  act as the templates and assembly lines for the synthesis of proteins.  Finally,  lipids  include a  large collection of structurally diverse bioorganic molecules including  fats ,  waxes ,  terpenes ,  and  steroids .    54",
