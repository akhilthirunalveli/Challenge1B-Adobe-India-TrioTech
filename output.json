Advanced Authoring  can be enabled by selecting the toggle in the upper right corner.  Advanced authoring:  •   Allows access to  all field types  (highlighted in yellow)  •   Supports  form field detection  (highlighted in green)  •   Supports  Prefill  fields  (highlighted in pink)  •   Supports  field assignment  (highlighted in purple and pink)  •   Supports  field validation",
