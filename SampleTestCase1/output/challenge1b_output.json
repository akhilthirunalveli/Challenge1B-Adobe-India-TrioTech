            "refined_text": "Datasets To well compare the performance of descriptor-based  and graph-based models, the dataset collection related  to drug discovery used by Attentive FP was also adopted  in this study [ 27 ]. This dataset collection contains 11 dif- ferent datasets originally reported in MoleculeNet for a  variety of chemical endpoints [ 32 ]. In the study reported  by Xiong et al. [ 27 ], the molecules that could not be suc- cessfully processed by RDKit [ 43 ] or the Attentive FP  model were excluded from the original datasets. The  details of those datasets are summarized in Table   2 .  Here, three datasets were used for the regression tasks,  including ESOL, FreeSolv, and Lipop, and the remain- ing eight datasets were used for the classification tasks,  which can be further divided into the single-task datasets  (ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipop, HIV, BACE, and BBBP) and the  multi-task datasets (CilnTox, SIDER, Tox21, ToxCast,  and MUV). Notably, we found that, in the ToxCast multi- task datasets, some subdatasets are extremely imbal- anced (the ratio of two classes is higher than 50) or quite  small (the number of compounds is smaller than 500).  impressive performance in modelling a variety of chemi- cal properties in comparison with several other graph- based methods. A majority of those studies claimed that  graph-based models are typically superior or comparable  to traditional descriptor-based models [ 24 ,  30 – 35 ], and  only a few studies gave the opposite conclusions [ 36 ].  For example, in 2017, Wu et  al. reported MoleculeNet,  a large benchmark for molecular machine learning, and  the evaluation results illustrated that graph-based meth- ods  outperformed descriptor-based methods on most  datasets [ 32 ]. Similarly, in 2019, Yang et al. introduced a  novel GNN framework named directed message passing  neural networks (D-MPNN), and the extensive evalua- tion on a large dataset collection indicated that D-MPNN  consistently matched or outperformed descriptor-based  methods on most datasets [ 24 ]. More recently, Korolev  et al. reported a universal graph convolutional networks  (GCN) architecture for the predictions of various chemi- cal endpoints [ 33 ], and the application of GCN illustrated  that its performance was comparable to state-of-the-art  ML algorithms such as SVM, RF, and gradient boosting  decision trees (GBDT).  In most of these reported studies, traditional ML  models such as LR, RF, SVM (especially ‘gold stand- ard’ RF) [ 31 ,  37 ] were employed to develop the predic- tion models based on a set of individual fingerprints  (especially Extended Connectivity Fingerprints, ECFP)  [ 31 – 33 ]. However, it is well known that the performance  of descriptor-based models is highly depending on the  descriptors used in training and many previous studies  have highlighted that ML models only based on molec- ular fingerprints are not such well-performing [ 4 ,  5 ,  38 ,  39 ]. In addition, little attention was paid to several newly  state-of-the-art ML algorithms, such as XGBoost and  LightGBM, which have illustrated great potentials for  modelling various molecular properties [ 39 – 42 ]. Accord- ingly, the conclusion that graph-based methods outper- form traditional descriptor-based methods still remains  controversial. The present study attempts to give a comprehensive  evaluation of descriptor-based and graph-based models  on 11 public datasets with different property endpoints.  Four ML algorithms were used to develop the descriptor- based models, including SVM, extreme gradient boost- ing (XGBoost), RF and deep neural networks (DNN).  In order to better represent the chemical and structure  features of the molecules for the descriptor-based mod- els, the combination of one set of molecular descriptors  (206 MOE 1-D and 2-D descriptors) and two sets of fin- gerprints (881 PubChem fingerprints and 307 substruc- ture fingerprints) were considered, and such molecular  representations are also commonly seen and easily acces- sible.
