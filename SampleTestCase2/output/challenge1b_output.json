In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general has experienced, and may in the future  experience, extreme fluctuations, which has caused, and may in the future cause, our stock price to decline for reasons unrelated  to our financial performance. Volatility in our stock price has increased, and may continue to increase, our susceptibility to  securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which  may adversely affect our business.",
